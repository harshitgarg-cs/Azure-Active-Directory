# Azure-Active-Directory

## Task
You are the IT administrator for Sam’s Scoops. You know that SSO is an effective way of allowing employees to use company applications without having to repeatedly sign on. To familiarize yourself with SSO, you are first tasked with configuring the company’s Azure Active Directory with a sample application provided by Microsoft called SAML Toolkit. Then, configure this application so that it can be accessed without having to re-enter your user details. Document every step with a screenshot and a brief description of what’s involved in every step of the process.
