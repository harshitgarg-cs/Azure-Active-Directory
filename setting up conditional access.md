# Azure Conditional Access Policy - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a Conditional Access policy in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that requires users to complete multi-factor authentication (MFA) when signing in from a non-corporate device.

This is part of the Microsoft Cybersecurity Certificate program.

## ðŸ“– Introduction
Conditional Access policies in Azure AD are used to enforce security controls based on user actions and access conditions. This guide walks through creating a policy that requires MFA when users access resources from non-corporate devices.

## âœ… Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following before proceeding:

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
Azure AD Premium (P1 or P2) or trial
Administrator privileges in Azure AD
Test user account for validation

### ðŸ›  Step-by-Step Guide
**Step 1:** Sign in to Azure
Go to the Azure Portal.
Sign in with your administrator credentials.
Search for Conditional Access in the search bar.

**Step 7:** Create and Test the Policy
Sign in to an Azure AD-protected resource (e.g., Microsoft 365) using a non-corporate device.
If configured correctly, you should be prompted for MFA.

## ðŸŽ¯ Results
After following these steps, you have successfully:
âœ… Created a Conditional Access policy in Azure AD.
âœ… Configured MFA for users signing in from non-corporate devices.
âœ… Tested the policy to ensure it works correctly.

## ðŸ”Ž Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of Conditional Access policies in enhancing security within an organization. By enforcing MFA for non-corporate devices, businesses can prevent unauthorized access and reduce security risks.
